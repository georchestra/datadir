# Datafeeder

## Alter links at the end of the process

In order to edit the links at the end of the process, you can edit the `frontend-config.json` and change the links at the end of the file.

Example:

```json
{
  "links": [
    "geonetwork",
    "openlayers",
    "ogc-features",
    {
      "uri": "/datahub/dataset/:uuid",
      "title": {
        "default": "See data in Datahub",
        "fr": "Voir le jeu de donn√©es dans datahub"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Three links can be provided by the backend and their url are set in `datafeeder.properties` file:
- `geonetwork`: link to the metadata in GeoNetwork (key: `datafeeder.publishing.geonetwork.public-url`)
- `openlayers`: link to the map in Geoserver which shows a preview of geo-dataset (key: `datafeeder.publishing.geoserver.public-url`)
- `ogc-features`: link to the OGC Features in Data-API (key: `datafeeder.publishing.ogcfeatures.public-url`)

The last link is a dynamic link which is generated by the frontend. Translation are determined by the browser's language.

You can use the `:uuid` placeholder which is the Geonetwork's uuid.
